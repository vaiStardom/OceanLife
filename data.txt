http://media.eol.org/content/2013/11/03/02/23834_orig.jpg,Coral,Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria. They typically live in compact colonies of many identical individual polyps. The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans and secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton.,Corals are marine invertebrates in the class Anthozoa of phylum Cnidaria.,,Coral,,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral
